# Multi-Disease-Checker
A system to test and identify whether you have a certain type of disease

## Inspiration
We all saw how everyone started go panic during the onset of pandemic and it was because of the lack of solid information and the spread of fake news. And this is how people fall under the misconception of true symptoms of a disease. That is why we wanted to build a project that will allow people to identify whether they have a certain type of disease or not.

## What it does
As the name of the project suggests, it is a device using which people will be able to check whether they are suffering from a certain kind of disease. Our project at present can check the following types of diseases:
-If one is COVID positive or not
-If one is allergic from airborne allergens or consumed allergens
-If one is suffering from a cold or a flu
The Multi Disease Checker conducts the test quizes of the selected type of disease and then displays the final verdict to the user. One can switch between the type of disease they want to check about. The quiz is very basic as it asks the user about the symptoms of the disease and based on their answer ('YES' or 'NO') to each question, at the end it predicts the type of disease the user is suffering from or what should the user do now to get better.
